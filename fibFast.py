# ANALYZE the solution

# This is an inefficient way to solve the Fibonacci sequence
# It wil run in Î˜(2^n)
#   1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... -> 2^n

# To solve a problem using DP, it must have:
#   1: Optimal Substructure (an optimal solution can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions of its subproblems)
#       |> We can get the right answer by combining our solutions to the subproblems
#   2: Overlapping Subproblems (if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times)
#       |> Calling fib(5) results in fib(4) and fib(3), calling fib(4) calls fib(3) and fib(2), fib(5) and fib(4) both call fib(3).


# SUBPROBLEMS, identify the SUBPROBLEMS

# In this case the subproblems are just the recursive calls to fib.
# Now that we know the subproblems, we can memoize the solutions.
